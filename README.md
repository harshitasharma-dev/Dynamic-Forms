Dynamic Forms : Forms in which application user can decide how many inputs or values should be there.
This concept makes the use of forms more dynamic and compatable to user.

In this repository, I have created two files App.js and MultiValue.js . 
In App.js, there is single input value in form including an alert in removing the last value, as I have kept one value as mandatory.
In MultiValue.js, there are two input values in form using an array. You can check the output in Inspect Element after clicking on Submit buutton, you can display it on screen as well by using the same logic as App.js.
